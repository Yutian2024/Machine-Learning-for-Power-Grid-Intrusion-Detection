## Abstract
The incorporation of automated control and communication into the power grid
allows for greater control, yet introduces cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Recently,
the Electric Power and Intelligent Control (EPIC) testbed was created to provide
realistic data collection environment for the purpose of building Intrusion Detection
System (IDS) attack detection models using Machine Learning (ML). This study
looks to design a deep learning (DL) IDS approach using the EPIC_A dataset,
specifically a Deep Neural Network (DNN), and provides an evaluative comparison
against several baseline non-neural network (non-NN) architectures. However,
most of the non-NN models performed similarly or better than the DNN. Still,
current studies provide support for the efficiency of the DNN. Future work should
look to further optimize the DNN model via a more comprehensive approach to
designing, tuning, and training.
